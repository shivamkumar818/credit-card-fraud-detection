Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This project implements a machine learning-based system to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. It leverages advanced algorithms to analyze transaction patterns and distinguish between legitimate and suspicious activities. The system aims to minimize false positives while accurately detecting fraud, ensuring both security and user convenience.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses transaction data for optimal model performance.


Machine Learning Models: Utilizes algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks for classification.


Evaluation Metrics: Includes precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy to assess model performance.


Real-Time Detection: Capable of detecting fraud dynamically from transaction data.


Scalability: Designed to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.


This project showcases the potential of machine learning in enhancing financial security and preventing fraudulent activities.
